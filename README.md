### Research Assistant (RA)
Shuoyang Wang is employed as a RA for several educational course development projects across Department of Mathematics & Statistics and Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology. Please see the Projects below for details. 

## Projects (In-Progress)
### Mean Field Gradient-based Optimization Algorithm
> May 2023 - Present
* Area: Theoretical Molecular Physics & Quantum Chemistry
* Role: Thesis Student, Collaborator
* Supervisor: Dr. Paul W. Ayers (McMaster)
* Description: Hartree-Fock is a mean-field method used to solve the molecular electron structure problems. Traditionally, the Hartree-Fock is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) procedures through fixed point optimization, which often encounters divergence and limited connection to modern methods (e.g. DMFT, MRCI, FANCI). In this project, we uses second quantization formalism to constructed a generalized version of Hartree-Fock with second-order SCF which is more flexible to adapt to other orbital optimization methods such as density functional theory (DFTs).

### Chem 1AA3 OER (Online Organic Chemistry Textbook)
> May 2023 - Present
* Area: Education (Chemistry)
* Role: Co-author, Employee
* Supervisor: Dr. Anthony Chibba, Dr. Sharonna Greenberg (McMaster)
* Description: Write and edit an H5P online organic chemistry textbook for the second introductory chemistry course CHEM 1AA3 at McMaster University.

### ChemFAST (Online Question Bank)
> January 2023 - Present 
* Area: Education (Chemistry)
* Role: Colaborator, Employee
* Supervisor: Dr. Sharonna Greenberg
* Description: Develop ChemFAST online question bank for introductory chemistry courses CHEM 1A03, CHEM 1AA3.

## Projects (Finished)
### MacPRIME (Transition Course)
> January 2023 - August 2023
* Area: Education (Mathematics)
* Role: Developer & Instructor, Employee
* Supervisor: Dr. Caroline Junkins 
* Description: Develop and teach 2023 MacPRIME (McMaster Peer-Run Inclusive Math Experience) program to make incoming math & stats students have better 1st year math-learning experience. 

### CHEM 2A03 Lab Report Videos (Course Development)
> May 2023 - August 2023
* Area: Education (Chemistry)
* Role: Colaborator, Employee
* Supervisor: Dr. Lydia Chen
* Description: Create Post-lab videos to help students to learn the statistical methods to analyze lab data for analytical chemistry course at McMaster Univeristy.
